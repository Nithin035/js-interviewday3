    <p>1.Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</p>
    <li>local scope/functional scope: variables which are assigned inside the function is known as local/functional scope</li>
    <li>global scope:variables which are assigned /declared at the top of the programe or outside</li>
    <li>block scope: variales which are assigned using let and const are accesed within the block {}</li>
    <li>scope chain:js engine also uses scope to find variables</li>
    <pre>
        //1 local scope
function add(){
    var a=20;
    console.log(a)
}
add()
    </pre>
    <pre>
        var glo=30;
function glob(){
    console.log(glo)
}
glob()
    </pre>
    <pre>
        //block
{
    let abc=100;
    console.log(abc)
}
    </pre>
    <pre>
        //scope chain
        var x=24;
function OuterFunction()
{
console.log(x)
}
OuterFunction();
    </pre>
    <p>2.What is the use of setTimeout</p>
    <li>settimeout is used to excute the code after the specified duration</li>
    <pre>
        setTimeout(()=>{
            console.log("nithin")
        },6000)
    </pre>
    <p>3.How many operators do we have in JS ?</p>
    <li>js has 4types of operators</li>
    <li>1.arthimetic operator</li>
    <li>2.comparsion operator</li>
    <li>3.assignment operator</li>
    <li>4.logical operator</li>
    <p>4.What are objects in javascript?</p>
    <li>in js objects are non primitaive data type structures which stores elements in key pair value</li>
    <pre>
        let obj={
            name:"pavan",
            age:23
        }
        console.log(obj)
    </pre>
    <p>5.What are function constructors?</p>
    <li>in js function constructor is a way of creating a new object type,using function as a blueprint for the object properties  and methods</li>
    <pre>
        function Person(name, age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            
            this.sayHello = function() {
              console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
            };
          }
          const person1 = new Person('John', 30);
          const person2 = new Person('Jane', 25);
        
          person1.sayHello(); 
          person2.sayHello();
    </pre>
    <p>6.Explain prototypes</p>
    <li>every object in js has a built in property which is called its prototype</li>
    <li>prototype is itself an object an object have prototype object present in it</li>
    <pre>
        function person1(){
            this.name='john',
            this.age=23
        }
        const person12=new person1()
        console.log(person12)
    </pre>
    <p>7.What is prototype chain</p>
    <li>Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to
        inheritance in a class based language.
        The prototype on object instance is available through Object.getPrototypeOf(object) or proto
        property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through Object.prototype.</li>
        <pre>
            let fruits=["apple","banana"]
            console.log(Array.prototype)
        </pre>
    <p>8.Give an example of inheritance using function constructor</p>
    <pre>
        function child(name, age){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        };
        function description(name, age, id, cls,gender){
            child.call(this, name, age, id, cls,gender);
            this.id = id;
            this.cls=cls;
            this.gender = gender;
        };
        let student1 = new child('Nithin', 135);
        let student2 = new description('pavn', 118, 143, 'Btech');
        console.log(student1);
        console.log(student2);
    </pre>
    <p>9.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</p>
    <li>Undefined is a datatype in JS which means a variable is declared but its value is not specified. It is also the default value of a variable declared using 'var' upon hoisting.</li>
    <li>Not defined is shown on the console when a variable is used for something but it was never declared.</li>
    <li>NAN stands for 'not a number' which is the value given to a number if it contains alphabets or any special character.</li>
    <p>10.Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</p>
    <li>a self invoking function also known as an immediately invoked function is a js function that runs as soon as it is defined ,the function is wrapped in parenthess and is invoked immediately after it is defined</li>
    <pre>
        (function ()
        {
        var message = "IIFE";
        console.log(message);
        //IIFE
        }
        )();
